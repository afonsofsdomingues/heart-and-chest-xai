# Machine Learning for Healthcare - Project 2

## Overview
This project investigates interpretable and explainable machine learning methods for medical classification tasks using both tabular and imaging data. In Part 1, we focus on the heart disease prediction task, applying shallow models like logistic regression with L1 regularization and deep models such as MLPs and NAMs, using SHAP for post-hoc explanation. In Part 2, we analyze chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection with CNNs, employing saliency-based methods including Integrated Gradients and Grad-CAM to highlight relevant image regions. Our findings offer insights into selecting suitable, trustworthy, and interpretable models for practical medical applications.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
      1. **Part 1 (Heart Disease Prediction)**:
          - Have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
          - Create a virtual environment:
            ```bash
            python -m venv venv_part1
            source venv_part1/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_part1\Scripts\activate
            ```
          - Install dependencies:
            ```bash
            pip install -r requirements_1.txt
            ```

      2. **Part 2 (Pneumonia Prediction)**:
          - Create another virtual environment:
            ```bash
            python -m venv venv_part2
            source venv_part2/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv_part2\Scripts\activate
            ```
          - Install dependencies:
            ```bash
            pip install -r requirements_2.txt
            ```

2. **Prepare the Datasets**:

    For **Part 1**
    - Download the [Heart Disease Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).
    - Unzip the dataset and place its contents in the `heart_failure/` folder.

    The file structure for this part should look like:
    ```
    heart_failure/
    ├── test_split.csv
    ├── train_val_split.csv
    ```

    For **Part 2** (Pneumonia Detection):
    - Download the dataset from [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
    - Unzip the dataset and place its contents in the `chest_xray/` folder.

    The file structure for this part should look like:
    ```
    chest_xray/
    ├── test/
    │   ├── NORMAL/
    │   │   ├── ...
    │   ├── PNEUMONIA/
    │       ├── ...
    ├── train/
    │   ├── NORMAL/
    │   │   ├── ...
    │   ├── PNEUMONIA/
    │       ├── ...
    ├── val/
    │   ├── NORMAL/
    │   │   ├── ...
    │   ├── PNEUMONIA/
    │       ├── ...
    ```

3. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Execute the Jupyter notebooks:
     - `heart_failure.ipynb` for part 1
     - `pneumonia.ipynb` for part 2
